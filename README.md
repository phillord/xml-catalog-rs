Support for XML Catalog Files
=============================


This is an early stage repo that is designed to support [XML catalog files](https://www.oasis-open.org/committees/entity/spec.html).

My main use case is to support
[Horned-OWL](https://github.com/phillord/horned-owl) parsing of
Ontology files. So it is likely that this will be biased toward
supporting the catalog files produced by the [OWL
API](https://github.com/owlcs/owlapi) rather than a complete
implementation.
